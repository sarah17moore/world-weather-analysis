# Overview

This is a classwork example in which "a hypothetical travel company, PlanMyTrip," will use data retrieved from OpenWeatherMap API, Google Places API, and Google Directions API to help customers plan trips based on preferred weather. 

In /Weather_Database and /Vacation_Search: Users will first input a range of preferred vacation temperatures (in degrees Fahrenheit). Next, they can interact with a Google Maps widget to see hotel information for hotels in cities that have temperatures in the preferred range (today).

In /Vacation_Itinerary: A travel itenerary was created by a beta-tester. A driving itenerary is given for 4 hotels that are in a close range of each other.
